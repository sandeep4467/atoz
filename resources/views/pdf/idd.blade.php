            <br><br>
            Our mortgage services are limited to advising on first and second charge mortgage products only. We have access to most Lenders accept Lloyds Group (Halifax and Birmingham Midshire), Santander and Nationwide Group (Nationwide and The Mortgage Works). We will consider most lenders we have access to before recommending a suitable mortgage product following an assessment of your personal needs and circumstances. This will include a detailed assessment of affordability.

                    <li>Second Charges</li>
                </ul>
                Our mortgage services are limited to advising on second charge mortgage products only. We will not consider all lenders available to you by going direct. The Only Lender we use for Second Charges are Together. Therefore, we cannot compare the lender with other lenders in the market who may offer more suitable products. We have to access each case before recommending a suitable mortgage product following an assessment of your personal needs and circumstances. This will include a detailed assessment of affordability. We would also like to confirm that on second charge we don’t have so many lenders on our panel as we only deal with one lender.
                When increasing your borrowing or consolidating existing loans you may have the options of;
                <ul>
                    <li>taking out a further advance with your existing provider</li>
                    <li> arranging a new first charge mortgage </li>
                    <li> borrowing through an unsecured loan. </li>
                </ul>
                Whilst these may be more appropriate for you, we will not consider the merits of these when making our recommendation to you.
                <ul>
                    <li> Insurances</li>
                    <li>We only use Legal and General for Protection needs. We will advice and recommend term assurance, income protection, critical illness, accident sickness and unemployment from Legal and General Only. Due to limited advice we will not be able to compare product which might be available to you direct and may be cheaper. </li>
                    <li>For Building and contents, we will search the market and advice accordingly. </li>
