            <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;"><strong><u>Priorities, Objectives and Basis of Advice</u></strong></p>
            <p>At our meetings we discussed the benefits and importance of reviewing all aspects of your personal and financial planning needs. <em style="color: red; font-weight: 700;">(then choose A or B)</em></p>
            <ul style="color: red;">
                <li>You placed no restrictions on the advice I provided you with. As a result of our discussions you confirmed your priorities and objectives at this time are as follows;</li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="color: red;">
                <li>List here</li>
                <li>List here</li>
                <li>List here</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="color: red;">This letter sets out my recommendations to you based on the information you provided to me.</p>
            <p style="color: red;">I also identified shortfalls in your personal cover in the areas of (<em>list areas here</em>) and although you do not wish to consider these further at this time, I recommend you contact me in the near future to ensure cover is arranged.</p>
            <ul style="color: red;">
                <li>Whenever advice is provided I prefer to review all areas of personal and financial needs to ensure the most comprehensive levels of cover and protection are in place to protect the interests of my clients. It was your decision however to limit my advice to your priorities and objectives as follows;</li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="color: red;">
                <li>List here</li>
                <li>List here</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="color: red;">As the information about your personal circumstances is limited to this/these area(s) my advice is limited also and may have been different otherwise. This letter sets out my recommendation(s) to you based on the information you provided to me.</p>
            <p style="color: red;">I recommend you review all other areas of your personal and financial circumstances at the earliest time possible to ensure you are not financially disadvantaged in the event of an unforeseen circumstance.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;"><strong><u>My Recommendation to you</u></strong></p>
            <p style="color: red;">You have requested the mortgage be set up on (a capital and interest) (interest only) basis, as this best suits your requirements for (tax deduction/income) from the property.</p>
            <p>The term of <span style="color: red;">(xx years)</span> was selected as this keeps monthly payments to a minimum. A feature of this mortgage means if you are in a position to contribute additional funds you can do so <em style="color: red;">without penalty at anytime/provided you do not exceed XX% of the total mortgage amount during any annual period/after the initial fixed period has ended</em></p>
            <p style="color: red;">If Commercial Buy to Let -</p>
            <p style="color: red;">You were made aware that Buy to Let mortgages entered into by the way of business are not regulated as a residential mortgage and therefore the provision of our service does not hold the additional level of consumer protection as for residential mortgages.</p>
            <p>You should seek separate legal and tax advice regarding your responsibilities of owning this type of property.</p>
            <p>Based on your requirements above I have research the market and I recommend <span style="color: red;">(insert lender)
            </span>for the following reasons ........</p>
            <p style="color:red; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 700;"><strong>INSERT REASONS FOR CHOICE OF LENDER & PRODUCT</strong></p>
            <p>Full details of the mortgage, including the fees and charges, are contained within the Lender&rsquo;s Illustration which has been provided. This will also explain the circumstances in which the lender can increase its mortgage rate at times other than an increase in the Bank of England base rate or after any initial discounted or fixed rate period. This also confirms the risk to the property if you do not keep up repayments. Please ensure that you read this document carefully. If there are any points on which you are unsure or require further clarification, please contact me and I will be pleased to explain in greater detail.</p>
            <p>You should seek separate legal and tax advice regarding your responsibilities of owning this type of property.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;"><strong><u>Affordability</u></strong></p>
            <p>It is anticipated that the rental income will be sufficient to cover the monthly mortgage repayments. However, if you are unable to find a suitable tenant you will be required to meet the repayments yourself. We therefore discussed in detail your current income and expenditure and established that you have a disposable monthly income of &pound;<span style="color: red;">XXX</span>. The initial mortgage repayment is &pound;<span style="color: red;">XXX</span> per month. At the end of the initial period, based on the lender&rsquo;s current standard variable rate, your mortgage repayments will change to &pound;<span style="color: red;">XXX</span> per month. It is likely the base rate of interest will increase during the term of your mortgage. Examples of how this will affect your payments are confirmed in the mortgage illustration provided to you, however, based on your current and future foreseen circumstances these repayments are affordable both now and in the future during periods when the property is not let.</p>
            <p>It is important to ensure that you have sufficient capital available immediately or at short notice to meet the cost of any unforeseen short-term emergencies. <span style="color: red;">You confirmed you have sufficient emergency funds in place <strong><em>OR</em></strong> You confirmed you will commit to saving regularly for this purpose.</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;"><strong>Our Charges </strong></p>
            <p style="color: red;">Confirmation of our fee and /or the commission we will receive is / are shown in Key Facts Illustration (KFI). </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;"><strong><u>Wills</u></strong></p>
            <p style="color: red;">You have confirmed you currently have (a) valid Will(s) in place. You should always review your Will(s) whenever your circumstances change.</p>
            <p style="color: red;"><strong><em>OR</em></strong></p>
            <p style="color: red;">You advised me that you do not have (a) valid Will(s) in place. I strongly recommend that you have (a) Will(s) written as soon as possible as there can be tax-planning advantages from Will writing and this can ensure that as much as possible of your estate is distributed according to your wishes.</p>
            <p style="color: red;">I therefore recommend that you seek advice from a solicitor to implement this. <strong><em>OR</em></strong> I have therefore referred you to (name of solicitor / firm) to implement this.</p>
            <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px; color: red;" ><strong><u>Insurance Cover </u></strong></p>
            <p style="color: red;">We would also like to confirm that it is your responsibility to have a suitable cover in place. We have discussed this in detail with you and you have declined our recommendations to all the insurance products. This is because you feel that you have no need for it. I will strongly suggest reviewing your decision and contacting me as soon as possible. You have also confirmed to me suitable cover for Building is in place to cover this property</p>
            <p style="color: red;"><strong><em><u>OR</u></em></strong></p>
            <p style="color: red;">We discussed your need to protect this property (and its contents).&nbsp; Having considered a range of different insurers (<em>we have recommended/you have chosen</em>) the following policy;</p>
            <p style="color: red;">Insurer:</p>
            <p style="color: red;">Cover: Building - &pound;xxxxxx / Contents - &pound;xxxxx</p>
            <p style="color: red;">Excess: Building - &pound;xxx / Contents - &pound;xxx</p>
            <p style="color: red;">Accidental Damage: Building Yes/No / Contents Yes/No</p>
            <p style="color: red;">Specified Items:</p>
            <p style="color: red;">Additional Features:</p>
            <p style="color: red;">The reason (<em>for recommending/you selecting</em>) this policy was due to the insurer&rsquo;s high defaqto rating and competitiveness of premium. You confirmed the premium of &pound;xxx pm was affordable to you.</p>
            <p style="color: red;">Full details of this policy is detailed in the Key Facts Policy Summary and you should read this carefully to fully understand how the policy works and what you are, and are not, covered for, together with other important information.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;"><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
